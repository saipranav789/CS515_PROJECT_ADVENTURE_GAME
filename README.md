## Hours Spent on project:

> Around 12 hours

## How I tested my code:

> I tested my code by creating a map file called prof.map which contains the vanilla map for the testing of the base line functionality of this project. I further used the autograder to match the outputs for the given verbs

## any bugs or issues I could not resolve:

> None I was able to resolve all issues

## an example of a difficult issue or bug and how you resolved

> A issue i resolved while making this project is preventing a infinity loop situation by using proper break and pass statements while running the game.

## a list of the three extensions I have chosen to implement, with appropriate detail on them for the CAs to evaluate them

> ### directional shortcuts/abbreviations:
>
> > Instead of using the go verb i.e: "go east" the player can just type the first letter i.e: "e" to move in that direction.

> ### drop verb:
>
> > I have implemented a drop verb where the player can drop items from their inventory into the room they are currently in.
> > i.e drop [item name] **example: drop clear stone**
> > If a item is dropped the item is added to the room's items after it is removed from the inventory

> ### help verb:
>
> > I have implemented a help verb which displays all the inputs the user can give in the game and the what each input does.
