## Hours Spent on project:

> Around 12 hours

## How I tested my code:

> I tested my code by creating a map file called prof.map which contains the vanilla map for the testing of the base line functionality of this project. I further used the autograder to match the outputs for the given verbs

## any bugs or issues I could not resolve:

> None I was able to resolve all issues

## an example of a difficult issue or bug and how you resolved

> A issue i resolved while making this project is preventing a infinity loop situation by using proper break and pass statements while running the game.

## a list of the three extensions I have chosen to implement, with appropriate detail on them for the CAs to evaluate them

> ### directional shortcuts/abbreviations:
>
> > Instead of using the go verb i.e: "go east" the player can just type the first letter i.e: "e" to move in that direction.

> ### drop verb:
>
> > I have implemented a drop verb where the player can drop items from their inventory into the room they are currently in.
> > i.e drop [item name] **example: drop clear stone**
> > If a item is dropped the item is added to the room's items after it is removed from the inventory

> ### help verb:
>
> > I have implemented a help verb which displays all the inputs the user can give in the game and the what each input does.

## how to play game:

> The setting of the game takes place in a fantasy magical land which is suffering because of demon lord leviathan (The villain of the story). You are a warrior set out to defeat the demon lord. But as you are now you dont have enough magical powers to defeat him.

> Inorder to defeat him you need to navigate through the game_map and find 6 orbs scattered across the map. Only with the power of the 6 orbs the demon lord can be defeated. In the game you will come across other items which are of no use to defeat the demon lord. A player can carry only 6 items in his inventory. You must only pick up the orbs and drop useless items you pick up on your journey.

## winning / losing conditions:

> The player will navigate blindly through out the map. You will not know what comes next when you select a direction to go. If the player happens to enter the demon lord's dojo before collecting the 6 orbs. The player will be killed by the demon lord instantly causing the player to lose. The player will be given the option to either restart the game from the starting room or quit the game.

> If the player has all 6 orbs in their inventory when they enter the demon lord's dojo they win!
